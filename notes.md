* interprocess communication is pretty confusing to implement in rust. There isn't a straight forward way. I wanted to make a daemon application that'll hold onto the history of our jumps. I wanted to learn how to do IPC in rust but seeing how there isn't just one answer that is cross platform friendly, I'd rather just get the history feature out as opposed to researching. At least for now
